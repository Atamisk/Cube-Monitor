This is a signal handler test for a small cubesat project. 

The basic idea is to have the control system respond to user-generated signals and signals generated by external processes, through SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. 


As it stands, the objective of the code is to be portable, but this may change as higher level functionality (e.g. GUI) are added.
